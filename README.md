# predicting-house-prices
Housing is a critical part of any nation's economy, and understanding the factors that influence home prices can provide valuable insights to investors, policymakers, and consumers. Economic signals such as inflation, interest rates, and unemployment are widely believed to affect housing markets, but the relationship is complex.

Context: In a constantly fluctuating economy, stakeholders in the housing market—such as real estate firms, banks, and policy makers—need tools that can anticipate future trends. Predicting house prices based on economic indicators enables:

-Real estate firms to make informed investment decisions -Banks to evaluate mortgage risk more accurately -Policymakers to adjust fiscal strategies based on expected housing trends

This project aims to develop a predictive model that uses various economic indicators to forecast median house prices across the U.S., providing data-driven insights and visual dashboards to assist decision-making.

Objectives: -Analyze trends in economic indicators (like inflation, unemployment, and mortgage rates) and their historical impact on house prices.

-Identify the most influential factors affecting house price movement.

-Develop a machine learning model to predict future house prices based on current and historical macroeconomic data.

-Explain model behavior using SHAP to ensure transparency in predictions.

-Evaluate the model’s fairness by analyzing potential biases (e.g., over/underestimation during economic booms or recessions).

-Visualize all key insights through an interactive QlikView dashboard for non-technical stakeholders.
